# Glad Youâ€™re Here â€” Take a Look at My Work ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Aditya Saiful Rizky, a Technical Writer with a background in Informatics Engineering and a passion for making technology easy to understand. With hands-on experience in creating user guides, system documentation, and database dictionaries, I enjoy simplifying technical information so it feels accessible for everyone â€” not just developers. I believe good documentation is more than just instructions; it's a bridge that connects technology with real people, improves user experience, and helps teams work more efficiently.
